# Abstract

The aim of this project is to use deep learning algorithms to improve Optical character recognition (OCR) of the Persian alphabet. Recent advances in deep learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to classify Persian letters, numbers and words. Additionally, new approaches are investigated in image segmentation when there is semantic complexity. Residual Neural Networks are used to achieve 99.7% classification accuracy.
